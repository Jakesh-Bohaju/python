co-ordinate geometry library can be use to calculate following 
1. Distance between two point
2. Mid point between two point
3. Section formula both internally and externally
4. centroid of triangle
5. slope of line

variable used
x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3, m, n
Here x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3 are vertices and m & n are ratio for section formula 

function call
1. for distance formula : distance_between_two_point(x1, x2, y1, y2)
2. for mid point formula : mid_point(x1, x2, y1, y2)
3. for internal section formula : internal_section_formula(x1, x2, y1, y2, m, n)
4. for external section formula : external_section_formula(x1, x2, y1, y2, m, n)
5. for centroid of triangle : centroid_triangle(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3)
6. for slope of line : slope_line(x1, x2, y1, y2)

note: import coordinate_geometry_lib for implenemtation
eg: from coordinate_geometry_lib import *
