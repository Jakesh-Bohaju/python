Simple Interest Calculator Library Documentation
variables
p = principal
t = time in year
r = interest rate
i = simple interest

functions
for calculation of simple interest
                    interest(p,t,r)
for calculation of interest rate
                    rate(p,t,i)
for calculation of time in year
                    time(p,r,i)
for calculation of principal or investment
                    principal(i,r,t)
for calculation of amount
                    amount(p,i)
Output
siinterest, simple interest output
sirate, interest rate output
sitime, time in year output
siprincipal, principal output
siamount, amount output


Implementation
for accessing all import all 
eg: from simple_interest_lib import *
for accessing interest only
eg: from simple_interest_lib import interest
for accessing interest and time
eg: from simple_interest_lib import interest, time

and so on.....
