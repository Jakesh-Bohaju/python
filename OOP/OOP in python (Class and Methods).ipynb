    "## OOP in python \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "Python is an “object-oriented programming language.” This means that almost all the code is implemented using a special construct called classes. Programmers use classes to keep related things together. This is done using the keyword “class,” which is a grouping of object-oriented constructs.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object\n",
    "Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of OOP Terminology\n",
    "* Class − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class variable − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data member − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function overloading − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operator overloading − The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.\n",
