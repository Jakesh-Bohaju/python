    "Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some another class. The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "* It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "* It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parent class** is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\n",
    "**Child class** is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class. In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss inheritance in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a derived class can inherit base class by just mentioning the base in the bracket after the derived class name.\n",

    "## Method Resolution Order\n",
    "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order. "
