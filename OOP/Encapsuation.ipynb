    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "In an object oriented python program, you can restrict access to methods and variables. This can prevent the data from being modified by accident and is known as encapsulation.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions operating on that data into a single component and restricting the access to some of the object’s components.<br>\n",
    "Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object’s definition.<br>\n",
    "A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions,variables etc.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation gives you more control over the degree of coupling in your code, it allows a class to change its implementation without affecting other parts of the code."

    "### Public\n",
    "Every variable and method that you've seen so far with the exception of the constructors has been public. Public variables and methods can be freely modified and run from anywhere, either inside or outside of the class. To create a public variable or method, don't use any underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private\n",
    "The private designation only allows a variable or method to be accessed from within its own class or object. You cannot modify the value of a private variable from outside of a class. Private variables and methods are preceded by two underscores. Take a look at the example below.<br>\n",

    "### Protected\n",
    "Protected variables and methods are very similar to private ones. You probably won't use protected variables or methods very often, but it's still worth knowing what they are. A variable that is protected can only be accessed by its own class and any classes derived from it. That is more a topic for later, but just be aware that if you are using a class as the basis of another one, protected variables may be a good option. Protected variables begin with a single underscore.\n",
